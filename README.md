## Contribute

### Clone and install dependecies

- Clone Barney git
```
git clone https://github.com/D-Mobilelab/barney.git barney
```
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), if not already installed
```
npm install -g bower grunt
```
- Install NPM and Bower dependecies
```
npm install
bower install
```

### Create a new feature

Barney uses [Git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to create a new feature or make an hotfix.

- Create a new feature branch from "develop" branch
```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/newfeature
```
- Code!
- Commit and push on feature branch
- When the feature is ready, merge feature branch on "develop", resolving possible conflicts
- Delete local and remote feature branch, after merge
```
git branch -d feature/newfeature
git push origin :feature/newfeature
```
- When a new version of Barney can be created, read the section below

### Create a new version
- When the "develop" branch contains new features ready for production, create a new pull request from develop to master branch
- Check the code with other developers and when you are ready, merge!
- Travis starts automatically for every pull request and push on "master" branch. If all test are successful, es-lint is successful, the documentation is created without problems and the coverage is sent to coveralls successful, then Travis approves the merge and a new version can be created
- On "master" branch use this grunt command
```
grunt version
```
- Barney uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) to create a new version
- You can choose between a major version, a minor version or a patch
```
? Current: 1.1.0 - Choose a new version for Barney: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ No new version 
  Major Version (2.0.0) 
  Minor Version (1.2.0) 
  Patch (1.1.1)
```
- Describe the features of this new version, seperating them with semicolons
```
? Features for version 1.1.0 (use ";" to separate features): ()
```
- Commit and push *CHANGELOG* and *bower.json*
```
git commit -a -m "New feature"
git push origin master
```
- If travis build is successful, create a new git tag with the name of new version and push this
```
git tag 2.0.0
git push --tags origin
```
- Push new documentation
```
git subtree push --prefix docs origin gh-pages
```
- The new Barney version is ready and you can update this with bower (see "How to update Barney" section above)
