### Create a new version
Barney uses [Git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to create a new feature or make an hotfix and [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) to create a new version.

- When you push on <i>master</i> branch, Travis checks if all test are successful, es-lint is successful, the documentation is created without problems and the coverage is sent to coveralls successful. If everything goes well, then Travis approves the merge and a new version can be created
- On <i>master</i> branch use this command
```
grunt version
```
- You can choose between a major version, a minor version or a patch
```
? Current: 1.1.0 - Choose a new version for Barney: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ No new version 
  Major Version (2.0.0) 
  Minor Version (1.2.0) 
  Patch (1.1.1)
```
- Describe the features of this new version, seperating them with semicolons
```
? Features for version 1.2.0 (use ";" to separate features): ()
```
- Commit, Push, Tag, Docs and NPM version will be automatically updated during the grunt version process!

- The new Barney version is ready!
